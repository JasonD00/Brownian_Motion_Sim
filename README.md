# Brownian Motion Simulation

A simple simulation of Brownian motion created with Python and the Pygame library.

# Why I built this?

I created this project becuase I am interested in simulating real-world physics and biological reactions with code.

## What is this?

This project visualizes **Brownian motion**, which is the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, who first described the phenomenon in 1827.
The program creates a number of white particles that fluctuate randomly around the screen, leaving a fading trail to show their path.

## Features

- **Randomized Movement:** Each particle moves in a slightly different direction, simulating natural, random motion.
- **Fading Trails:** A transparent surface is used to create a subtle, fading effect that traces the path of each particle.
- **Continuous Loop:** Particles wrap around the screen edges, ad continue in random patterns.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python and the Pygame library installed.

1.  **Install Python:** If you don't have Python, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2.  **Install Pygame:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

### Running the Program

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `brownian_motion.py`).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python brownian_motion.py
    ```
